## Amazon-Prime-Content-Analysis-Visualization
This project analyzes and visualizes data from a large content library, similar to Amazon Prime Video, to gain insights into content trends and inform strategic decision-making.  
The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the library's characteristics, including title distribution, genre popularity, rating trends, geographical origins, and release year patterns.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a clear and concise overview of a content library's key attributes.  By analyzing and visualizing this data, we can answer questions like:

* What are the most popular genres?
* How does content rating distribution look?
* What is the balance between movies and TV shows?
* Where does the content originate geographically?
* How has content production evolved over time?

These insights can be valuable for content acquisition, marketing, and overall platform strategy.
